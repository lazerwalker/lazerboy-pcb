# Game Boy Button PCB

This is a PCB that fits into a Nintendo DMG-1 (1989 Game Boy) shell. It's designed to take in button input, with traces that fit the original button placement, and route them to a convenient 9-pin output (4-way d-pad, A/B/Start/Select buttons, common ground). In my case, I connect them directly to the GPIO of a Raspberry Pi Zero.

It's based on Rolf's [DMG-Rolf](http://gbdev.gg8.se/files/schematics/DMG-Rolf/) project, but far simplified since this board contains only button contacts and no actual logic.
